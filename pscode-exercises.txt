// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

prompt for user to input a whole number(make sure it only accepts whole numbers)

if user enters odd number return message "odd"

if user enters even number return message "even"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

prompt for user to input 5 different numbers

Store the numbers in an array

Add all variables together then divide the sum by 5  to get the average

Store the average in a variable

Iterate through the array to find the smallest and largest numbers

Store each number in their own variables

print "average" and the repective variable

print "largest and smallest" as messages alognside the respective variables
